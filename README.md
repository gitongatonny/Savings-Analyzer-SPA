# Simple Savings Calculator [SPA]

This simple webapp calculates the user's potential savings.
It's a static webpage that stores no data.

Its functionalities are:

* Input for expenses and income.

* Once the above are submitted:
  * A pie chart of the expenses is created.
  * A table displaying the totals [income, expenses & potential savings] is displayed.

The pie chart sections' colours change randomly* on each submission of data.

Below is a screenshot of the web-app.
